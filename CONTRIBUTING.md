## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Always use TypeScript, avoid `any` types
- Define interfaces for all props and data structures
- Use proper type imports: `import type { ... }`

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop destructuring
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Keep styles consistent with Claude's color scheme
- Ensure responsive design works on all devices

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
feat: Add time range filtering to leaderboard
fix: Correct GitHub avatar URL construction
docs: Update README with deployment instructions
style: Format code with prettier
refactor: Extract common utilities to lib folder
```

## Testing

Before submitting a PR:

1. Run the linter:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

2. Run type checking:
   ```bash
   pnpm type-check
   ```

3. Test your changes thoroughly:
   - Sign in/out flow works
   - File upload works correctly
   - Leaderboard displays properly
   - Filters work as expected
   - Mobile responsiveness is maintained
